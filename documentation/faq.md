# FAQ
- **Problem**: _The translation/transcript is too slow, and it shows the warning:_

  _`UserWarning: FP16 is not supported on CPU; using FP32 instead.`_

  **Answers**: This means that the AI is not running on your GPU but on your CPU instead.
  - The whisper AI is running best on CUDA enabled GPUs.
    
    NVIDIA starting from GTX 1080 should do.
  - It is possible that CUDA is not installed on your System. (see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites))

- **Problem**: _The translation/transcript is still too slow. But no warning appears._

  **Answers**:
  - Your GPU might be busy with another Task or you are using a too big model for your GPU.
    
    Look in Task-Manager how much the GPU is used without running the AI or change to a smaller model like `small` or `tiny` using `--model small` or `--model tiny`. (see [Command-line flags](#command-line-flags))
  
  - If you happen to have a secondary PC with an GPU, you can outsource the workload to it:
    
    Run the AI on the secondary PC, start the Websocket-Server with `--websocket_ip 0.0.0.0` to have it listen on all its IP-Addresses.
    
    Change the IP of the websocket-client to use to the one from the **Secondary** PC. (Open the html file with parameter: `index.html?ws_server=ws://127.0.0.1:5000` to use secondary's PC IP-Address.)

    For OSC, give it the IP of your **Primary** PC using the `--websocket_ip 127.0.0.1` argument and change the `127.0.0.1` to its IP.

    Stream the Audio to the **Secondary PC** using for example https://vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/vban.htm

- **Problem**: _On startup, i get the following error:_

  _`RuntimeError: CUDA error: out of memory`_

  **Answers**: This means that your GPU does not have enough memory to run the AI.
  - Try to use a smaller model like `small` or `tiny` using `--model small` or `--model tiny`.

  - If you happen to have a secondary PC with an GPU, you can outsource the workload to it. (see previous answer for more information).

- **Problem**: _On startup, i get the following error:_
  
  _`OSError: [Errno -9999] Unanticipated host error`_

  **Answer**: This can mean that your PC is blocking access to your selected Audio device.
  
  Or That you just have the wrong Audio Device selected.
  Sometimes you can find the Name of your Audio Device multiple times in the List.
